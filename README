dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


This DWM version includes pertag, systray, noborder, alwaysoncenter patches.

Bstack and Gaplessgrid layouts added.

Also you can define bottom or top gap in config.h. ex: if you use some bar like dzen and you need tp reserve the space...


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
